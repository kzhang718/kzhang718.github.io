          A primordial black hole is a hypothetical type of black hole that
          formed not by the gravitational collapse of a large star but by the
          extreme density of matter present during the universe's early expansion.

        <div class="section-description">
          A stellar black hole (or stellar-mass black hole) is a black hole
          formed by the gravitational collapse of a massive star. They have
          masses ranging from about 5 to several tens of solar masses.

          A supermassive black hole is the largest type of black hole, on
          the order of hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses,
          and is found in the center of almost all massive galaxies.
